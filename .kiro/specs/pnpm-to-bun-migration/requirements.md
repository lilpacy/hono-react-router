# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the current project from using pnpm as the package manager and workspace tool to using bun. The migration should maintain all existing functionality while taking advantage of bun's performance benefits and unified tooling approach. The project currently uses pnpm with workspace configuration and needs to be converted to use bun's workspace system instead.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from pnpm to bun as the package manager, so that I can benefit from bun's faster installation and execution speeds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use bun instead of pnpm for package management
2. WHEN running package installation THEN bun SHALL install all dependencies correctly without errors
3. WHEN checking package versions THEN all dependencies SHALL maintain their current versions unless explicitly updated
4. IF there are pnpm-specific configurations THEN the system SHALL convert them to bun equivalents

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain workspace functionality with bun, so that the monorepo structure continues to work as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using bun workspaces THEN all workspace packages SHALL be properly linked and accessible
2. WHEN running scripts from workspace root THEN bun SHALL execute them in the correct workspace context
3. WHEN installing dependencies THEN bun SHALL respect workspace dependency resolution
4. IF there are workspace-specific scripts THEN they SHALL continue to work with bun

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing scripts and commands to work with bun, so that the development workflow remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running npm scripts THEN bun SHALL execute them successfully
2. WHEN using package.json scripts THEN they SHALL work identically to the pnpm version
3. WHEN running build, test, or dev commands THEN they SHALL produce the same results as before
4. IF there are CI/CD scripts THEN they SHALL be updated to use bun instead of pnpm

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove pnpm artifacts and configurations, so that the project is clean and only uses bun.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN pnpm-lock.yaml SHALL be removed from the project
2. WHEN checking project files THEN .npmrc configurations SHALL be reviewed and converted to bun equivalents if needed
3. WHEN examining the project THEN no pnpm-specific files SHALL remain
4. IF there are pnpm references in documentation THEN they SHALL be updated to reference bun

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be reversible, so that I can rollback if issues are discovered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing the migration THEN a backup of the current pnpm-lock.yaml SHALL be created
2. WHEN issues are discovered THEN the migration SHALL be easily reversible
3. WHEN rolling back THEN all original functionality SHALL be restored
4. IF the migration fails THEN clear rollback instructions SHALL be available
